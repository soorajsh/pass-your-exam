1.	a) Determine how many zeros end the number 300! + 6415 X 125'°. 
	b) What is the last digit of 7^4563? 
	c) Prove by mathematical induction that 
		1 + 3^1 +3^2+3^3 + ............+ 3^n = 1/2{3^(n+1) - 1}. 

2.	a) Prove the law of cosines: given a triangle ABC, if alpha(a) the angle determined by sides
	   AB and AC, then 
	   |BC|^2 =|AB|^2+|AC|^2-2|AB||AC|cos(a). 
	b) Find the nuniber of vertex, edge and face if polyhedron with three pentagonal faces meets

3. 	a) There are eighty marbles all looks the same but one is lighter find it in four weighing? 
	b) Exaimine the equations 
				1 = 1 
			      1-4 = -(1+2) 
			    l-4+9 = 1+2+3
			 1-4+9-16 = -(1+2+3+4)

4. 	a) Solve Five disc Hanoi Problem: "There are five discs, of increasing size, on the leftmost post.
	   The goal is to move all the discs, in the same configuration, to the rigth most post. There are 
	   three posts. The rules are that any disc that is on the top of any can be lifted and moved to any
	   other post. However at no time are we allowed to place a larger disc a top a smaller disc. What is 
	   a strategy for moving all five discs to the rightmost post with the fewest movement? 
	b) "Six people, named A, B, C, D, E, F, are in the dining car of a train. They are one each from 
	   New York City, Chicago, 'Tulsa. St. Louis, Milwaukee, and Atlanta. The following facts are known:
	   i. A and the man form New York City is physicians.
	  ii. E and the woman from Chicago are teachers.
	 iii. The person from Tulsa and C are engineers.
	  iv. B and F are veterans of the Gulf war, but the persin from Tulsa has never served in the millitary.
	   v. The person from Milwaukee is older than A.
	  vi. The person from Atlanta is older than C.
	 vii. At St. Louis, B and the man from New York get off.
	viii. At San Francisco, C and the man from Milwaukee gets off.
	Match the names of the people with their professions and their cities.

5. 	a) Calculate the sum: 1.2.3 + 2.3.4 + 3.4.5 + ... + n(n+1)(n+2)
	b) In a 4 X 4 array of square, put the first sixteen odd integers 1 to 31, one in each square , so that 
	   each row and coloumn adds up to same number.
	c) An efficiency expert is doing study of a certain fast food restaurant. She observes that a particular
	   waiter drops 30% of all the hamburgers that he servers. What is the propability that he will drop exactly

	   of water. It is tapered at the top and has a screw-on cap. How can you accurately determine the volume of the 
	   bottle if you are equipped with a ruler?
	c) Prove:
